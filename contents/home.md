# About NNRL

The Neuroscience and Neuroengineering Laboratory (NNRL) at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Tehran is dedicated to advancing research in neuroscience. Our work focuses on areas such as working memory and decoding neural signals like LFP, EEG, and fMRI. Equipped with state-of-the-art tools like eye trackers and EEG recording systems, NNRL aims to unravel the complexities of the brain through innovative experiments and analysis.
